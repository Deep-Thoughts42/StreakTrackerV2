# StreakTrackerV2
This project is a basic web-app that I created to gain familiarity with the MERN stack and full-stack development in general. It's meant to track basic items, and it starts a global stopwatch from the time the streak is created. Streaks can be added, edited, and deleted.

I can not verify that this code will work on your system, as I built this a long time ago and wanted to quickly learn the MERN stack. For your own testing purposes, you would need to insert your own MongoDB URI, but this is probably best kept as a reference.
